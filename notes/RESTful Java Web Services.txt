Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) is an important principle of the REST application architecture.
-json processing models
--object, loads whole file into memory and parse
--stream, read/write data in blocks(elements)
-@path: can be added to a class or method
	runtime will parse the path with leading or trailing slashes in same way
